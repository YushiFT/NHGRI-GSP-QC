## About
Pipelines for analyzing the genomics data from National Human Genome Research Institute's Genome Sequencing Program (NHGRI GSP). Mainly focusing on the genotyping data analysis, but also include some necessary phenotyping data manipulation. Topics include but not limited to the Quality Control (QC) pipeline, ethnicity prediction method, and genomic data manipulation.

## Note
We would release the source code for our python package once our paper passes the peer review.
